## AES Implementation in Ruby
This is ruby implementation of AES. I was always curious how it worked, 
so this implementation favors deriving all look up tables instead of 
hardcoding them and avoids guarding against attacks, e.g. timing attacks,
for the sake of educational clarity.

```ruby
    bytes = [ 0x32, 0x43, 0xf6, 0xa8, 0x88, 0x5a, 0x30, 0x8d, 0x31, 0x31, 0x98, 0xa2, 0xe0, 0x37, 0x07, 0x34 ]
    key =  [ 0x2b, 0x7e, 0x15, 0x16, 0x28, 0xae, 0xd2, 0xa6, 0xab, 0xf7, 0x15, 0x88, 0x09, 0xcf, 0x4f, 0x3c]
    
    cipher(bytes, key)
    # => [0x39, 0x25, 0x84, 0x1d, 0x02, 0xdc, 0x09, 0xfb, 0xdc, 0x11, 0x85, 0x97, 0x19, 0x6a, 0x0b, 0x32]
```

### TODO
1. Support Decryption
2. Support 256 and 384 bit keys
